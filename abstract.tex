In this work, we reconstruct the well-known the fundamental plane
of black holes using data gathered from the state-of-the-art Illustris
cosmological simulation. The high resolution and detailed gas dynamics
allow us to evaluate the growth and evolution of black holes over
cosmic time. From the black hole physics implemented in Illustris,
we extract X-ray luminosities by assuming either an Eddington approximation
or the thin-disk model. Using these models, we calculate an efficiency
factor $q$ which describes the slope of the fundamental plane. We
find that the $q$ parameter derived from the black hole data in the
Illustris simulation is inconsistent with the Eddington approximation
and is within a factor of $\sim2$ of the accepted value for the thin-disk
approximation.
