We compile a sample of {\textasciitilde}100 active galactic nuclei with measured masses, 5-{GHz} core emission, and 2-10 {keV}
luminosities, together with eight galactic black holes with a total of {\textasciitilde}50 simultaneous observations in the radio and X-ray bands. Using this sample, we study the correlations between the radio ({LR}) and the X-ray ({LX}) luminosity and the black hole mass (M). We find that the radio luminosity is correlated with {bothM} and
{LX}, at a highly significant level. In particular, we show that the sources define a `Fundamental Plane' in the three-dimensional ({logLR}, {logLX}, {logM}) space, given by
{logLR}= (0.60+0.11-0.11)
{logLX}+ (0.78+0.11-0.09) {logM}+
7.33+4.05-4.07, with a substantial scatter of $\sigma$R= 0.88. We compare our results to the theoretical
relations between radio flux, black hole mass, and accretion rate derived by Heinz \& Sunyaev. Such relations depend only on the
assumed accretion model and on the observed radio spectral index. Therefore, we are able to show that the X-ray emission from black holes accreting at less than a few per cent of the Eddington rate is unlikely to be produced by radiatively efficient accretion, and is marginally consistent with optically thin synchrotron emission from the jet. On the other hand, models for radiatively inefficient accretion flows seem to agree well with the data.},

Microwave Anisotropy Probe ({WMAP}) mission. The full nine-year analysis
of the time-ordered data provides updated characterizations and
calibrations of the experiment. We also provide new nine-year full sky
temperature maps that were processed to reduce the asymmetry of the
effective beams. Temperature and polarization sky maps are examined to
separate cosmic microwave background ({CMB}) anisotropy from foreground
emission, and both types of signals are analyzed in detail. We provide
new point source catalogs as well as new diffuse and point source
foreground masks. An updated template-removal process is used for
cosmological analysis; new foreground fits are performed, and new
foreground-reduced {CMB} maps are presented. We now implement an optimal C
-1 weighting to compute the temperature angular power
spectrum. The {WMAP} mission has resulted in a highly constrained
$\Lambda${CDM} cosmological model with precise and accurate parameters in
agreement with a host of other cosmological measurements. When {WMAP} data
are combined with finer scale {CMB}, baryon acoustic oscillation, and
Hubble constant measurements, we find that big bang nucleosynthesis is
well supported and there is no compelling evidence for a non-standard
number of neutrino species (N eff = 3.84 {\textpm} 0.40). The
model fit also implies that the age of the universe is t 0 =
13.772 {\textpm} 0.059 Gyr, and the fit Hubble constant is H 0
= 69.32 {\textpm} 0.80 km s-1 Mpc-1.
Inflation is also supported: the fluctuations are adiabatic, with
Gaussian random phases; the detection of a deviation of the scalar
spectral index from unity, reported earlier by the {WMAP} team, now has
high statistical significance (ns = 0.9608 {\textpm} 0.0080);
and the universe is close to flat/Euclidean ({\textbackslash}Omega \_k = -0.0027{\textasciicircum}\{+
0.0039\}\_\{-0.0038\}). Overall, the {WMAP} mission has resulted in a
reduction of the cosmological parameter volume by a factor of 68,000 for
the standard six-parameter $\Lambda${CDM} model, based on {CMB} data alone.
For a model including tensors, the allowed seven-parameter volume has
been reduced by a factor 117,000. Other cosmological observations are in
accord with the {CMB} predictions, and the combined data reduces the
cosmological parameter volume even further. With no significant
anomalies and an adequate goodness of fit, the inflationary flat
$\Lambda${CDM} model and its precise and accurate parameters rooted in {WMAP}
data stands as the standard model of cosmology.},

measurements of the high-l cosmic microwave background anisotropy, the
baryon acoustic oscillation scale, and the Hubble constant, the matter
and energy densities, $\Omega$ b h 2, $\Omega$

in the primordial spectrum at the 5$\sigma$ level, confirming the first
detection of tilt based on the five-year {WMAP} data. At the end of the
{WMAP} mission, the nine-year data decrease the allowable volume of the
six-dimensional $\Lambda${CDM} parameter space by a factor of 68,000
relative to pre-{WMAP} measurements. We investigate a number of data
combinations and show that their $\Lambda${CDM} parameter fits are
consistent. New limits on deviations from the six-parameter model are
presented, for example: the fractional contribution of tensor modes is
limited to r {\textless} 0.13 (95\% {CL}); the spatial curvature parameter is
limited to {\textbackslash}Omega \_k = -0.0027{\textasciicircum}\{+ 0.0039\}\_\{- 0.0038\}; the summed mass of
neutrinos is limited to ?m $\nu$ {\textless} 0.44 {eV} (95\% {CL});
and the number of relativistic species is found to lie within N
eff = 3.84 {\textpm} 0.40, when the full data are analyzed.
The joint constraint on N eff and the primordial helium
abundance, Y He, agrees with the prediction of standard big
bang nucleosynthesis. We compare recent Planck measurements of the
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect with our seven-year measurements, and show
their mutual agreement. Our analysis of the polarization pattern around
temperature extrema is updated. This confirms a fundamental prediction
of the standard cosmological model and provides a striking illustration
of acoustic oscillations and adiabatic initial conditions in the early

Illustris is a large scale cosmological hydrodynamical simulation which resolves a (106.5 Mpc){\textasciicircum}3 volume with more than 12 billion resolution elements and includes state-of-the-art physical models relevant for galaxy formation. We find that the black hole mass density for redshifts z = 0 - 5 and the black hole mass function at z = 0 predicted by Illustris are in excellent agreement with the most recent observational constraints. We show that the bolometric and hard X-ray luminosity functions of {AGN} at z = 0 reproduce observational data very well over the full dynamic range probed. This requires radiative efficiencies to be on average low, epsilon\_r {\textless}= 0.1, unless the bolometric corrections are largely
underestimated. Cosmic downsizing of the {AGN} population is in broad agreement with the findings from X-ray surveys, but we caution that obscuration effects may introduce systematic biases in the flux-limited samples at the faint end. We also study black hole - host galaxy scaling relations as a function of galaxy morphology, colour and specific star formation rate. We find that black holes and galaxies co-evolve at the massive end, but for low mass, blue and star-forming galaxies there is no tight relation with either their central black hole masses or the nuclear {AGN} activity.},

The {SEDs} are presented both in figures and in tabular form, with additional tabular material published on {CD}-{ROM}. Previously unpublished observational data for a second set of quasars excluded from the primary sample are also tabulated. The effects of host galaxy starlight contamination and foreground extinction on the {UVSX} sample are considered and the sample is used to investigate the range of {SED} properties. Of course, the properties we derive are influenced strongly by the selection effects induced by quasar discovery techniques. We derive the mean energy distribution ({MED}) for radio-loud and radio-quiet objects and present the bolometric corrections derived from it. We note, however, that the dispersion about this mean is large (approximately one decade for both the infrared and ultraviolet components when the {MED} is normalized at the near-infrared inflection). At least part of the dispersion in the ultraviolet may be due to time variability, but this is unlikely to be important in the infrared. The existence of such a large dispersion indicates that the {MED} reflects only some of the properties of quasars and so should be used only with caution.},

	abstract = {We develop a model for the cosmological role of mergers in the evolution of starbursts, quasars, and spheroidal galaxies. By combining theoretically well-constrained halo and subhalo mass functions as a function of redshift and environment with empirical halo occupation models, we can estimate where galaxies of given properties live at a particular epoch. This allows us to calculate, in an a priori cosmological manner, where major galaxy-galaxy mergers occur and what kinds of galaxies merge, at all redshifts. We compare this with the observed mass functions, clustering, fractions as a function of halo and galaxy mass, and small-scale environments of mergers, and we show that this approach yields robust estimates in good agreement with observations and can be extended to predict detailed properties of mergers. Making the simple Ansatz that major, gas-rich mergers cause quasar activity (but not strictly assuming they are the only triggering mechanism), we demonstrate that this model naturally reproduces the observed rise and fall of the quasar luminosity density at z=0-6, as well as quasar luminosity functions, fractions, host galaxy colors, and clustering as a function of redshift and luminosity. The recent observed excess of quasar clustering on small scales at z{\textasciitilde}0.2-2.5 is a natural prediction of our model, as mergers will preferentially occur in regions with excess small-scale galaxy overdensities. In fact, we demonstrate that quasar environments at all observed redshifts correspond closely to the empirically determined small group scale, where major mergers of {\textasciitilde}L* gas-rich galaxies will be most efficient. We contrast this with a secular model in which quasar activity is driven by bars or other disk instabilities, and we show that, while these modes of fueling probably dominate the high Eddington ratio population at Seyfert luminosities (significant at z=0), the constraints from quasar clustering, observed pseudobulge populations, and disk mass functions suggest that they are a small contributor to the z{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}1 quasar luminosity density, which is dominated by massive {BHs} in predominantly classical spheroids formed in mergers. Similarly, low-luminosity Seyferts do not show a clustering excess on small scales, in agreement with the natural prediction of secular models, but bright quasars at all redshifts do so. We also compare recent observations of the colors of quasar host galaxies and show that these correspond to the colors of recent merger remnants, in the transition region between the blue cloud and the red sequence, and are distinct from the colors of systems with observed bars or strong disk instabilities. Even the most extreme secular models, in which all bulge (and therefore {BH}) formation proceeds via disk instability, are forced to assume that this instability acts before the (dynamically inevitable) mergers, and therefore predict a history for the quasar luminosity density that is shifted to earlier times, in disagreement with observations. Our model provides a powerful means to predict the abundance and nature of mergers and to contrast cosmologically motivated predictions of merger products such as starbursts and active galactic nuclei.},

We show that, while almost all galaxy haloes in an \{{OMEGA}\} = 1 universe have indeed increased their mass by more than 10 per cent over the last 5 Gyr, many of the associated satellites have not yet merged with the central galaxy. For a standard {CDM} cosmogony, our simulations suggest that fewer than 30 per cent of spiral discs have grown by over 10 per cent during the last 5 Gyr.

	abstract = {We use hydrodynamical simulations to study the color transformations 
induced by star formation and active galactic nuclei ({AGNs}) during major 
mergers of spiral galaxies. Our modeling accounts for radiative cooling, 
star formation, and supernova feedback. Moreover, we include a treatment 
of accretion onto supermassive black holes embedded in the nuclei of the 
merging galaxies. We assume that a small fraction of the bolometric 
luminosity of an accreting black hole couples thermally to surrounding 
gas, providing a feedback mechanism that regulates its growth. The 
encounter and coalescence of the galaxies triggers nuclear gas inflow, 
which fuels both a powerful starburst and strong black hole accretion. 
Comparing simulations with and without black holes, we show that {AGN} 
feedback can quench star formation and accretion on a short timescale, 
particularly in large galaxies where the black holes can drive powerful 
winds once they become sufficiently massive. The color evolution of the 
remnant differs markedly between mergers with and without central black 
holes. Without {AGNs}, gas-rich mergers lead to elliptical galaxies that 
remain blue owing to residual star formation, even after more than 7 Gyr 
have elapsed. In contrast, mergers with black holes produce elliptical 
galaxies that redden much faster, an effect that is more pronounced in 
massive remnants where a nearly complete termination of star formation 
occurs, allowing them to redden to u-r{\textasciitilde}=2.3 in less than 1 Gyr. {AGN} 
feedback may thus be required to explain the population of extremely red 
massive early-type galaxies, and it appears to be an important driver in 
generating the observed bimodal color distribution of galaxies in the 
local universe.},
