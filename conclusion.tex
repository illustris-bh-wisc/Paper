\section{Conclusions}

\label{sec:conclusions}In this work, we have analyzed the complete
of supermassive black holes from the state-of-the-art cosmological
hydrodynamical simulation Illustris-2. Applying well-known models
of black hole phenomena, we calculated the x-ray and radio luminosities
as a function of black hole mass. Using the empirically-derived relation
between these three quantities, we have shown that the...

In future work, we plan to perform the following analyses:
\begin{itemize}
\item Go to higher redshift to trace the evolution of the fundamental plane
over cosmic time
\item test the Bondi-Hoyle accretion model
\item Trace the temperature and density of the gas inside of the halos as
a function of redshift to determine how the feedback is affecting
the environment
\item With the temperatures, we can then estimate radio luminosities to
more exactly compare with the M03 fundamental plane
\item Examine the effect of mergers on the slope of the fundamental plane\end{itemize}
