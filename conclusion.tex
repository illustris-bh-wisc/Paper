\section{Conclusions}

\label{sec:conclusions}In this work, we have analyzed the complete
of supermassive black holes from the state-of-the-art cosmological
hydrodynamical simulation Illustris-2. Applying well-known models
of black hole phenomena, we calculated the x-ray and radio luminosities
as a function of black hole mass. Using the empirically-derived relation
between these three quantities, we have shown that the
